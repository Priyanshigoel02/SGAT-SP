# SGAT-SP

For quite some time, both industry experts and academic scholars have directed substantial attention toward researching stock market volatility. Most of the existing research focuses on using singular features such as closing prices, opening prices or news stories to predict stock movement. There has been some research on using graph neural networks to aggregate node features from related stocks. Most of these methods focus on node aggregation and edge attention techniques. The proposed work builds upon previous research which investigated the behavior of Sparse Graph Attention Mechanism on Stock Trend Prediction. A novel transformer model for capturing the long-term dependencies of stock price data is used to replace LSTM which is one of the most frequently used conventional techniques when it comes to forecasting stock prices using time-series data. This component constitutes one segment of the three modules used for feature extraction, which ultimately are fed into the sparse graph attention network. Additionally, for constructing the graph, the model utilizes the top 10 relations as identified in ML-GAT (Multilevel Graph Attention Network), thereby eliminating a number of irrelevant and noisy relations that do not contribute to enhancing accuracy. Finally, the trends for each GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) sector of the S&P 500 index are forecasted. In comparison with the best performance benchmark model â€“ SGAT-SP (Sparse Graph Attention Network for Stock Prediction), eSGAT-SP has an average accuracy score of 0.842 and an average F1 score of 0.77 along with a near perfect recall with the average value of 0.84 across all the GICS sectors despite having a smaller number of edges.
